        <p>If you’re like most of us, you have goals you’d like to accomplish. Even when your goals feel very important to you, they sometimes take a long time to accomplish, maybe even many years.</p>
        <p>The same goes for habits we’re trying to change, whether we want to add positive habits or reduce/eliminate negative ones. We’d like to change the way we behave in our day-to-day lives in order to be healthier, advance our careers, be better with money, or improve our relationships with friends and family. </p>
        
        <p>All too often, when we struggle to accomplish our goals or modify our habits, we attribute our shortcomings to a lack of knowledge and/or discipline. Sure, in some circumstances we might need to learn more or seek out expert help. Consistency is arguably the most important component of accomplishing any goal, so it’s true that discipline matters - especially when a habit is new or you’re struggling to stay motivated.</p>

        <p>Realistically, most people know what they need to do; they struggle with the how. We get tempted by fancy or intense strategies and forget the value of basic habits that can be performed consistently and sustainably. The basics aren’t as sexy because they’re…well, basic. We need less focus on what, and more focus on how.</p>

        <p>Sherpa is here to help.</p>

        <p>We realize that there are plenty of goal and habit tracking apps out there. Our aim is to help you approach goal setting and habit change in a more nuanced way. We have to explore why we struggle with executing basic behaviors.</p>

        <p>When you set up new goals or habits on Sherpa, you’ll be encouraged to think about how your goals and habits relate to the rest of your life. You’ll consider what resources and tools you can use to make things easier. We want to reduce our reliance on discipline by making positive habits easier to perform, more enjoyable, and by making their associated benefits more immediate and recognizable (the opposite is true if we’re trying to reduce or eliminate an existing habit - make it unattractive and difficult to perform). You’ll think about what obstacles are likely to arise and consider possibilities for how to overcome them or avoid them altogether. You’ll explore the preparatory steps that you might need to take so that, when you’re ready to adopt a new habit or start pursuing a goal, you’ll be good to go. </p>

        <p>Most importantly, you’ll think about your unique values and priorities. We need to not only ask what you want and why you want it; we also want to explore how it relates to other things you really  care about. We don’t struggle to eat more healthily merely due to gluttony; maybe your kids want to have pizza and, in the moment, making them happy feels more important than sticking to a strict diet. Maybe you want to save more money, but your friend’s 30th birthday is coming up and you’d like to take them out for a nice meal. Obviously, each of these represents single decisions, neither of which would make or break a person’s chances at accomplishing an important goal. Nonetheless, they illustrate that our behaviors are often out of alignment with our goals for reasons that are not only understandable, but instead are grounded in very positive values.</p>

        <p>Sherpa isn’t here to tell you what to do. We’re here to help you reflect on what’s important to you, then act as your guide to devise and implement realistic solutions that mesh with the rest of your life.</p>
        
        <p>Let’s walk the path together!</p>
